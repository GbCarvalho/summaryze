# Summaryze

This project is about a problem that took place in one work meeting and I realized that maybe it was possible to automaticaly get some videos from an specific folder at the google drive and summarize them at one application, its now work in progress but I pretend to start getting some data until the end of this year.

There are a few things under devolpment with some "// TODO -" tag and its proposital, the codes that has this tag is because they existed but it began to being errored and I removed to not bring problems to the application.

This project can be runned with yarn or npm, not tested with other package managers.
